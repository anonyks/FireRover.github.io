## What is QuickTest Files?

**QuickTest Files** is a minimalist repository crafted for hosting and sharing single or few pages of test files. This space serves as a sandbox where I explore new ideas, test quick fixes, or demonstrate simple code snippets. It's all about learning, experimenting, and sharing small-scale projects.

## What's Inside?

You'll find a variety of test files hereâ€”anything from HTML pages testing a new web design technique to simple scripts demonstrating a programming concept. Each file is an isolated experiment, making it easier for others to understand and learn from.
